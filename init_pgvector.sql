For simplicity, we are directly adding the content into this table as
a column containing text data. It could easily be a foreign key pointing to
another table instead that has the content you want to vectorize for
semantic search, just storing here the vectorized content in our "items" table.

"768" dimensions for our vector embedding is critical - that is the
number of dimensions our open source embeddings model output, for later in the
blog post.
